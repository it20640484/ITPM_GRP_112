## Project Description
### Migration is a phenomenon happening ever since the world began. Moving from one place to another is known as “migration”. This can be across cities or even across countries in the world. The main reasons for animal migration are due to food availability, breeding, climate, survival, and habitats; human migration is also directly or indirectly aligned with the same reasons as animals. While the main reason for human migration is because of economic opportunities, they also migrate due to social, political, and environmental factors.
### When considering Sri Lanka, most citizens have been migrating to other countries for economic factors. This migration has increased in recent years due to the economic instability of the country. Due to the high interest in migration among citizens of all ages, it has become an easy playfield for migration visa scammers where they lure their victims by providing them promising salaries and facilities that no one can provide even for average educated people. Few Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) in Sri Lanka has identified that people from Kandy and Anuradhapura region have become victims of such migration scam.
### There are different types of migration scams identified which is currently happening in the above-mentioned regions and the following are a few of those illegal activities,
### 	Requesting application fee for visa applications – Many visa applications are available free of charge on the respective embassy’s website, but these scammers charge a higher price for providing these applications.
### 	Consultation fees – Fraudulent agencies provide false consultations for a higher fee.
### 	Registration fee – While many legitimate agencies take a nominal fee for document processing, fraudsters are paying higher registration fees to process the documents and charge the victims multiple times as well.
### 	False promise – some fraudsters make false promises on jobs and some fraudsters provide false information such as for that to reach their destination they should stay in another country for a few months.
### While there are many other types of scams happening related to migration it was identified that all these scams have become possible because of one reason that is, unavailability of reliable information and guidance from local authorities or information which is available is not easily accessible by citizens with low computer literacy or having poor user experience developed on available information systems.
### Our goal in this research is to identify issues of this information unavailability and make it easily available for anyone with below-average computer literacy.
